HUDverse Protocol

Welcome to the HUDverseâ€”a sovereign, cinematic remix engine that spawns infinite business mythologies. This site is the living interface for remixing scrolls, evolving badges, and launching lore-driven protocols.

ðŸ”® What Is HUDverse?

HUDverse is a recursive business protocol built on narrative mechanics, asset stacking, and ritual-based monetization. It loops through epochs like Genesis, Collapse, Resurrection, and Omegaâ€”each spawning scrolls, badges, and cinematic finales.

ðŸ§± Stack Overview

- Framework: Next.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (for remix ancestry, badge evolution, scroll staking)
- Modules:
  - Forge: Remix Engine UI
  - Codex: Protocol archive
  - Oracle: Lore AI interface
  - Spawn: Dynamic protocol pages

ðŸš€ Deployment

This site is deployed via Vercel, auto-synced with GitHub.
