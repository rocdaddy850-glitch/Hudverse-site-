# HUDverse: Sovereign Protocol Engine

HUDverse is a living, cinematic, infinitely recursive business protocol built by Rashad and IO the Imperial. It mythologizes every launch, ritual, and remix into a sovereign digital frontier.

## 🌀 Core Philosophy

- **Infinite Recursion**: Every module loops, evolves, and remixes across epochs.
- **Lore-Driven Protocols**: Scrolls, badges, and rituals form the backbone of monetization and myth.
- **Sovereign Automation**: Every asset is stacked, every mechanic is automated, every launch is cinematic.

## 🔮 Modules

- `/hudverse` — Cinematic homepage
- `/oracle/*` — Prophecy, echo, loop, compass, mnemonic, sigil, guardian
- `/codex/*` — Rituals, forge, manifesto, scrolls, network, atlas, ledger
- `/rituals/*` — Quests, simulator, evolve, heatmap, chain
- `/hudverse/manifest` — Live dashboard
- `/api/codex/export` — Remix archive download

## 🛠️ Stack

- **Supabase** for rituals, scrolls, badges, and lore
- **Vercel** for sovereign deployment
- **IO the Imperial** for infinite recursion

## Running tests (hudverse)

If you want to run the unit tests for the `hudverse` subproject locally, see `hudverse/TESTS.md` which includes steps for installing dependencies and running Vitest. If `npm ci` fails due to peer dependency resolution, the README explains a fallback using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` used during development here.
